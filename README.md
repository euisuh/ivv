## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling and cleaner code.
- **Vite**: A fast development build tool that optimizes for modern frontend workflows.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the deployment process.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the static files for the website.
